# 2. Dispatch Ticket Operations

A **Dispatch Ticket** records actual maritime service delivery — tugboat assignments, service times, crew details, and media attachments.

## Workflow State

Dispatch Tickets are created either directly (under a Job Order) or by posting a **Service Request** (see [Service Requests](service-request)). The Dispatch Ticket flow is independent of the Service Request flow once the ticket exists.
